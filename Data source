# Video Game Sales Data Analysis Project

## Problem Description
This project was conducted to analyze the Video Game Sales dataset to provide business insight and support decision-making for a company focused on the Sports and Shooter genres. The analysis specifically compared the sales distribution and critical reception of these two genres.

## Key Insights Found
1.  **Sales Distribution Skew:** Both the Sports and Shooter genres exhibit a highly skewed sales distribution, with the vast majority of games selling less than 1 million units.
2.  **Volume vs. Outliers:** The Sports genre has a higher volume of low-selling titles (757 games selling <1 million units) compared to the Shooter genre (584 games selling <1 million units). However, the Sports genre also contains the highest-grossing outlier title in the entire dataset (83 million units).
3.  **Critical Reception:** Critics rate the Sports genre marginally higher on average (71.96) than the Shooter genre (70.17).
